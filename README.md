# taxiApp
A price aggregation app for ride hailing services in Singapore.

You can now easily compare the prices between the various ride hailing services in singapore, 
and be automatically redirected to the respective application of your choice! No need to 
open multiple apps and try to compare them one by one.

  <h2>
    Here's a quick video on how this app works!
  </h2>
  <h3>
      - We have the starting screen
      - Then, we navigate to the screen where the user inputs their current location manually, 
        or the geolocation service will find the location of the user if Location access has been granted.
      - Following which, we go to the pickup/dropoff address page. The pre-saved locations in the drop
        down menu are all data from the "saved Places", which will be elaborated on later. 
      - Upon the filling of both pickup and dropoff locations, we automatically navigate to the 
        fare comparison page, where it displays the fares of the trips of the different Ride Hailing 
        services. (Please note the fares displayed in this demonstration don't take into account surge pricing!)
      - Upon selecting the preferred fare, user will be redirected to the appropriate app if it has already
        been installed in the user's phone, else user will be redirected to the app store/play store for downloading
        the app
